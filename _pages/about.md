##Jorge Pomares
======

I am a Full Professor at the University of Alicante, where I lead Space Robotics Laboratory of the HURO research group. I received my PhD in Computer Science from the University of Alicante, and since 2003 I have been part of the Department of Physics, Systems Engineering, and Signal Theory. My research focuses on space robotics, robotic control, and visual servoing.

Over the last two decades, my work has increasingly concentrated on space robotics, particularly on robot control strategies for Active Debris Removal (ADR), on-orbit servicing, and vision-guided manipulation in space. My research aims to advance the autonomous capabilities of space robots through optimal control, visual control, and learning-based approaches, including reinforcement learning for robust and scalable orbital robotic systems.

I have participated in more than 15 research projects and have led several initiatives in areas such as space robotics, vision-based robot guidance, and robot control. Throughout these projects, I have developed new control frameworks for a wide variety of robotic systems, including multi-DOF manipulators, redundant robots, mobile manipulators, aerial robots, exoskeletons, and orbital robotic platforms. My research is reinforced through long-term collaborations with national and international groups in robotics, control, and space systems.
Currently, I lead research in optimal and learning-based control for orbital robotics, aiming to enable future space systems to autonomously perceive, plan, and act in tasks such as debris removal, autonomous capture, and on-orbit servicing.
